# Geeetech-A10T-modded-Klipper-TMC2209-UART-GT2560-v4.0-

warning: do not use that as copy and paste solution. it won't work neither for a10t nor a10 as it requires additional Hardware to work.
Mainboard: GT2560 v4.0 

Hello here I am sharing my klipper Konfiguration for my heavily modified geeetech a10t which is converted to single direct drive extruder a10 with 1in1out hotend instead of the stock 3in1out mixing hotend.
Also some other stuff that requires additional hardwaare and/or modification. So you definitely cant copy paste whole config.
maybe it can be useful in one way or another for klipper User. 

Also I am sharing a manual how to install tmc2209 in uart mode for the different Mainboards the printer comes with. the manual was created by users from the official geeetech Facebook pages and was published there in the files section. Since this manual was nowhere else to be found so I thought I share it here for everyone. credits go to the users from that group for that manual.
All motherboard versions have been tested according to users there. for me it worked fine on gt2560 v4.0 . only downside is that u can only use 4 stepper in uart mode.
